## Architecture and Design


### Logical architecture

In this project, our group, going towards the already built uni4all architecture, applied the MVC (Model, View, Controller) pattern.

Furthermore, the well functioning of our app requires the storing and retrieving of persisting data. Thus, a need for a database arises.

### Physical architecture

Regarding the physical architecture of our project, it relies on three separate blocks that communicate via HTTPS requests (backend and Sigarra's server) and an integration between uni4all's backend and our app front-end made with Flutter technology.

### Vertical prototype
To help on validating all the architectural, design and technological decisions made, we usually implement a vertical prototype, a thin vertical slice of the system.

In this subsection please describe which feature you have implemented, and how, together with a snapshot of the user interface, if applicable.

At this phase, instead of a complete user story, you can simply implement a feature that demonstrates thay you can use the technology, for example, show a screen with the app credits (name and authors).
